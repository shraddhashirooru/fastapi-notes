# <p align="center"> Using HTTPException for Error Handling </p>
Welcome back! In our previous lessons, we learned how to implement status codes for different API operations, but we didn't focus on properly handling unsuccessful cases. In this lesson, we will dive deeper into error handling in FastAPI using the HTTPException class. Proper error handling is crucial for building robust and user-friendly APIs. It helps ensure that clients receive meaningful feedback when something goes wrong.

## What is an HTTPException?
An HTTPException in FastAPI is a specialized exception used to return HTTP errors in a structured way. Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program, and in the context of APIs, they help signal issues to the client.

When an HTTPException is raised, FastAPI automatically generates an HTTP response that includes the specified status code and error details. This allows clients to understand what went wrong and take appropriate actions based on the status code and message provided.

## Raising a HTTPException
By using HTTPException, we can specify the status code and details of the error, providing meaningful feedback to the clients.

Hereâ€™s how you can raise an HTTP exception:

Python
```
from fastapi import HTTPException

raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid request")
```
In this example, we raise an HTTP exception with a status code of 400 (Bad Request) and a detailed error message. Proper error handling is essential to prevent client-side errors and inform users when something goes wrong.

## Common Status Codes for HTTP Exceptions
When raising HTTPExceptions, it's important to use appropriate status codes to clearly communicate the nature of the error to the client. Here are some common status codes you might use:

**400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request because the client has sent an invalid request. Use this when the client sends malformed or invalid data.

**401 Unauthorized**: The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response. Use this when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

**403 Forbidden**: The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Use this for permissions issues.

**404 Not Found**: The server can not find the requested resource. Use this when the requested resource could not be found.

**409 Conflict**: The request conflicts with the current state of the server. Use this when there is a conflict that needs to be resolved, such as a duplicate entry.

**500 Internal Server Error**: The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle. Use this for unexpected server errors.

Using the right status code ensures that clients can handle the response correctly based on the type of error encountered.

## Creating an Endpoint with Error Handling
Let's see how we can add error handling to the read_crew_member endpoint.

First, we check if the crew_id is a positive integer. If not, we raise an HTTP exception with a status code of 400 (Bad Request). Next, we iterate through the crew list to find the member with the specified crew_id. If the member is found, we return their details. Otherwise, we raise an HTTP exception with a status code of 404 (Not Found):

Python
```
from fastapi import HTTPException, status

@app.get("/crew/{crew_id}", status_code=status.HTTP_200_OK)
async def read_crew_member(crew_id: int):
    if crew_id <= 0:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail="Invalid crew ID. Must be a positive integer."
        )
    for member in crew:
        if member["id"] == crew_id:
            return member
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
        detail="Crew member not found"
    )
```
With this implementation, clients will receive appropriate feedback if they provide an invalid crew_id or if the requested crew member is not found.

## Summary and Preparation for Practice
In this lesson, we explored how to use the HTTPException class for error handling in FastAPI, focusing on raising HTTP errors with appropriate status codes and messages to provide meaningful feedback to clients. We specifically implemented error handling in the read_crew_member endpoint, ensuring clients receive proper feedback when an invalid crew_id is provided or when a crew member is not found.

Congratulations on completing this lesson and the course! You have learned how to handle errors effectively in FastAPI, making your APIs more robust and user-friendly. Now it's time to put your knowledge into practice with some exercises. Good luck!
