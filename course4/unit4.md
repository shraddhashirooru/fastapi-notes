# <p align="center"> Handling Errors with Middleware</p>
Welcome to the final lesson of this course! This lesson explores how to handle errors using middleware in FastAPI. By the end of this lesson, youâ€™ll be able to create custom middleware that catches and manages errors, ensuring your FastAPI application is robust and user-friendly.

## What is a Middleware?
In FastAPI, middleware acts as an intermediary processing requests before they reach your endpoint and processing responses before they return to the client. Middleware is a powerful tool in web applications, useful for tasks such as logging, authentication, and crucially, error handling. By catching errors globally through middleware, you ensure consistent error management across your application.

## Middleware vs. Exception Handlers
In the previous lesson, we learned about exception handlers, which specifically handle exceptions raised during request processing. Middleware, on the other hand, can handle a broader range of issues, including errors, as it processes all requests and responses passing through the application.

## Implementing Custom Error-Handling Middleware
Letâ€™s dive into creating our custom middleware to handle errors. Middleware in FastAPI is created using the @app.middleware decorator.

Python
```
# Import Required Modules
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

# Define Custom Error-Handling Middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def error_handling_middleware(request: Request, call_next):
    try:
        response = await call_next(request)
    except Exception as e:
        return JSONResponse(
            status_code=500,
            content={"detail": "An unexpected error occurred and we caught it with our middleware"}
        )
    return response
```
In this code:

**Decorating the Function**: @app.middleware("http") tells FastAPI that this function acts as middleware for processing all incoming HTTP requests before they reach your endpoint and handle outgoing responses as well.

**Function Parameters**:
request represents the incoming HTTP request.
call_next is a function that sends the request to the next step in the processing pipeline, which could be another middleware or the actual endpoint. In this case, it attempts to execute the endpoint logic or forward the request to any subsequent middleware.

**Error Handling**:
The try block attempts to process the request.
If an exception occurs, itâ€™s caught in the except block.
We return a JSONResponse with status_code=500 and a custom error message.
## Summary and Practice Section
In this lesson, we took a deeper look at middleware in FastAPI and discovered how it can help with error handling. We also learned how to create custom error-handling middleware to make our applications more robust and user-friendly.

You're almost at the finish line! Now, dive into the practice exercises to solidify your newfound skills and complete the course. Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
