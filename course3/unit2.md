# <p align="center"> Handling POST Requests with Pydantic Models</p>
Welcome to another lesson into Pydantic models and their role in structuring and validating data in FastAPI. Today, we'll take a step further and learn how to directly receive a Pydantic model via a POST request.

The power of this approach is that we can send data directly to our API in the same structured format that our model defines. This significantly simplifies the request handling process and allows us to reduce the amount of error-prone manual data parsing.

## Quick Recap of Setup
Before we forge ahead, let's remind ourselves of our setup from the previous lesson. Here's a quick refresher:

Python
```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

# Mock database of crew members
crew = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Cosmo", "role": "Captain", "experience": 10},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Alice", "role": "Engineer", "experience": 8},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Bob", "role": "Scientist", "experience": 5}
]


# Defining the crew member model
class CrewMember(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role: str
    experience: int
```
## Working with POST Requests and Pydantic
With FastAPI's integration of Pydantic, when creating a POST endpoint, we can receive data directly from the body of the request and automatically validate it using Pydantic models. This means we don't need to manually extract the request body and parse it to extract each field. This is a major benefit as it reduces the amount of manual parsing code we need to write, making our API more robust and reliable.

## Receiving Data with a Pydantic Model
When creating a POST endpoint with FastAPI, we can receive data directly from the request body and validate it using Pydantic models.

Python
```
@app.post("/crew/")
async def add_crew_member(member: CrewMember):
    # ... remaining code ...
```
In the above example, FastAPI handles the request body by converting it into a CrewMember Pydantic model. The member parameter of the endpoint function is then populated with this model.

## How FastAPI Handles POST Requests with Pydantic
Using Pydantic models in POST requests automates and simplifies the process of data validation and structuring. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what happens:

**Data Parsing**: FastAPI automatically parses the JSON request body into the corresponding Pydantic model. This eliminates the need for manual parsing code.

**Data Validation**: As the data is parsed, FastAPI validates it against the Pydantic model's schema. This ensures the incoming data adheres to the specified format and types.

**Dependency Injection**: The validated data is then passed to the endpoint function as an instance of the Pydantic model. This makes it readily available for use within the function.

## Example of Adding a New Crew Member
Let's walk through an example to see how this works in practice.

Python
```
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

# Mock database of crew members
crew = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Cosmo", "role": "Captain", "experience": 10},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Alice", "role": "Engineer", "experience": 8},
    {"id": 3, "name": "Bob", "role": "Scientist", "experience": 5}
]

# Defining the crew member model
class CrewMember(BaseModel):
    name: str
    role: str
    experience: int

# POST endpoint to add a new crew member
@app.post("/crew/")
async def add_crew_member(member: CrewMember):
    # Generating new id
    member_id = max(c["id"] for c in crew) + 1 if crew else 1
    # Creating new member for database using the CrewMember object
    new_member = {
        "id": member_id,
        "name": member.name,
        "role": member.role,
        "experience": member.experience
    }
    # Adding new member to database
    crew.append(new_member)
    # Returning message and new member details
    return {"message": "Crew member added successfully", "details": new_member}
```
In this example, when a client sends a JSON payload to the /crew/ endpoint, FastAPI automatically converts it to a CrewMember model. The function add_crew_member then calculates a new id, creates a new dictionary, and appends it to the crew list. Finally, it returns a response containing a success message and the details of the newly added crew member.

## Handling Invalid Requests
What happens if the client sends an invalid request? FastAPI, leveraging Pydantic's validation capabilities, will automatically handle it for you:

**Validation Errors**: If the incoming data doesn't match the CrewMember model (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types), FastAPI returns a detailed validation error response.

**Error Response**: The response will have a status code of 422 Unprocessable Entity, indicating that the request's syntax or content was incorrect.

This ensures that only valid data gets processed by your API, maintaining data integrity and robustness.

## Summary and Upcoming Practices
Great work today! We dug deeper into FastAPI and Pydantic, learning how to directly receive a Pydantic model with a POST request. This simplifies API development by reducing manual data extraction and validation tasks.

Before we end this lesson, don't forget we have some practice exercises coming up. They will allow you to test your understanding and put your newfound skills to use. So, stay tuned and keep up the good work!
